## ‚úçÔ∏èOverview
This project is a web-based tool for encrypting and decrypting messages using the symmetric encryption algorithm provided by the `cryptography` library in Python. It is built using the Flask web framework and is intended for educational purposes to demonstrate the basics of web application development and cryptographic operations.

## üé®Features
- Encrypt plain text messages with a generated key.
- Decrypt messages using the provided key.

## Requirements
- Python 3
- Flask
- cryptography
